# How to _(wip)_

## Test locally

- Clone project `git clone https://github.com/x-ploration/x-stack.git`
- Install dependencies `npm install`

### Add env variables

- Copy `.env.example` into `.env`
- Add `AUTH_SECRET` with this [secret generator](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32) or with `openssl rand -base64 32`
- Add Discord provider `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` with https://discord.com/developers/applications. You will need to create a new application (top-right corner button `New Application`) and copy the “client id” and “client_secret” from the oauth2 settings.
- Add Planetscale env vars. `DATABASE` `DATABASE_HOST` `DATABASE_USERNAME` `DATABASE_PASSWORD` with https://app.planetscale.com/. Go to `branches`, select your branch, click `connect`, and copy/paste.

### Add discord redirect

- Add discord redirect to your localhost url (e.g. `http://localhost:5173/api/auth/callback/discord`)

### Replace GA4 property

- In root.tsx, change id=G-VNBJX46X1T to your own GA4 property id

## Deploy

- Push your code into a new GitHub repository
- Go to vercel dashboard, `Add New` project (top-right button), and select your repository. Remember to add production env vars (the database env vars should point to your production database).
- On your terminal, run build command `npm run build`
- On your terminal, run deploy command `npm run deploy`
- Add discord redirect to your production url (e.g. `https://x-stack.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/discord`).

# Evaluation & Alternatives _(wip)_

The days of the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) and MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stacks are over. For better or for worse, the web has gotten richer and richer. We now have amazing alternatives to what we used to use popping now and then, and this can feel overwhelming. So why not try to discuss and compare them in one single place?

## Fullstack Frameworks

When we look at a fullstack framework, we need to take into consideration many aspects: Reactivity; SSR; DX; the ecosystem. Most frameworks have at least acceptable levels of reactivity, SSR, and DX, but the ecosystem is what makes the difference. So who is winning the battle?

- 1️⃣ Qwik — Thanks to its serialized/resumable/compiled model, Qwik scores at the highest in many aspects: SSR _(ofc)_, but also Reactivity, DX, and **the ecosystem** (because you can run React inside of Qwik 🤯). Anything you can do in React, you can do in Qwik. But the opposite is not true. I wonder what could be possibly done in other frameworks that couldn’t be in Qwik 🤔.
- 2️⃣ React / Next / Remix — If you ask me, I’d say Next comes next (👈), followed by Remix. They are not as good in terms of Reactivity as Svelte, Solid, or even Vue, but you will find libraries you won’t find natively built in the other frameworks (e.g. [react webcam](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-webcam)) and get newer trendy libraries sooner (hi 👋 [shadcn](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui)).
- 3️⃣ Svelte — I’d say it’s Svelte, because it is lightweight and brings significant performance gains, and it has Sveltekit ready. Rich Harris has also got some swag 👌.
- 4️⃣ Vue / Nuxt 3 — Although I highly respect Daniel Roe, I think apart from small performance gains, Vue 3’s composition api is simply React hooks into Vue. It isn’t worth losing the ecosystem.
- 5️⃣ Solid / Solidstart — Although Ryan is one of my heroes, Solidstart is still not solid (👈) enough to be used in production ☹️.
- 6️⃣ Angular…

## Authentication

- 1️⃣ Auth.js/Next-Auth — Open-source; 100% free; surprisingly powerful and flexible for an open-source library.
  - You won't find even half of its available adapters anywhere else.
  - Allows you to easily write custom logic through callbacks.
  - You can set up RBAC/ABAC pretty easily.
  - You can use jwt instead of database sessions if you want, although it's can be more complex and thus less secure.
- 2️⃣ Clerk — Not open-source; hard to beat the DX; good if you’re not just looking for basic auth but a complete identity management solution that’s **easy** to use.
  - Supports RBAC/ABAC.
  - Supports jwt has a crazy number of frameworks and third-party integrations.
  - The only catch is that it’s good if you don’t have more than 10,000 users, because (I’ll let you do the maths) $0.02/$0.05 is not cheap.
- 3️⃣ Supertokens — Open-source; really powerful; fair pricing; can be self-hosted; not so easy; good if you’re looking for advanced auth and identity management features that you couldn’t find elsewhere.
- 4️⃣ Supabase Auth — Open-source; not free; works with Postgres and Row-level security; good if you only use postgres.
  - It uses jwt sessions with refresh tokens under the hood. Expiry time is set to 1 hour by default, which means that if an attacker gets hold of the jwt token (not the refresh token), he will have access to your user’s account until that jwt expires. This is why, if you’re using Supabase Auth, you should use it with Postgres for maximum security.
- 5️⃣ Firebase Auth — Not open-source; free but not free if you use identity platform; works with Firestore, Firebase real-time database, and Firebase security rules; good if you only use Firebase.
  - It uses jwt sessions with refresh tokens under the hood. Expiry time is set to 1 hour by default, which means that if an attacker gets hold of the jwt token (not the refresh token), he will have access to your user’s account until that jwt expires. This is why, if you’re using Firebase Auth, you should use it with Firebase security rules for maximum security.
- 6️⃣ Lucia — Open-source; 100% free; works with server loaders & actions only; doesn't support jwt sessions; A bit new and might be more flexible but might also require deeper auth knowledge to implement than Auth.js; good if you hate jayson web tokens.
- 7️⃣ Auth0 — not OAuth; not cheap; not easy to use.
- 8️⃣ AWS Cognito — If you want to be locked in AWS forever.
- 9️⃣ Google Identity Platform — If you want to be locked in GCP forever.
- 🔟 Okta, Onelogin, FusionAuth, Keycloak — don't know much about them.

> ⚠️ Push notifications now work with PWA on ios. Unless you need specific mobile features that aren't yet available on ios with the web APIs, PWA are by far the easiest solution for porting your web app to mobile, and they can be even more performant than React Native thanks to SSR.

- 1️⃣ PWA — Installable through ios and android apps stores; Suprising performance on Android thanks to [TWA](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/trusted-web-activity/); incredibly easy to port with the web manifest; Needs a bit more testing on ios as a webview.
- 2️⃣ Capacitor — Successor to Cordova; Slow on Android because [Android webviews are slow](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor/discussions/3899); Doesn't work with SSR; Can be buggy if you don't use Ionic; Plugins can be buggy too and aren't updated often.
- 3️⃣ Tauri — Slow on Android because [Android webviews are slow](https://github.com/ionic-team/capacitor/discussions/3899); Still in alpha/beta;

# FAQ _(wip)_

### Is the 𝕏 stack ready for production?

Although some pieces are still in beta (auth.js, drizzle, valibot, qwik-ui’s headless components), I am confident that this stack can already be used in production.

> ⚠️ Since some shadcn components must be rewritten natively or imported with qwikify$, this is a hard piece to use with Qwik atm. I have already started porting a few components and will spend most of my time on this before I can confidently release v1.

### Who are you?

I’m an indie dev and I’ve had the chance to work on many projects that required learning many different technologies. I have worked extensively with React Vanilla in a project that used the GRAND stack (Graphql, React, Apollo, Neo4j Database). I’ve worked with Next 12 for my portfolio website using the t3 stack. I’ve worked with Nuxt 3 on a French government site. And I’ve tried my hands at Sveltekit for a side hustle. I have to admit, I’ve only read Solid’s documentation 🙈.

### Why?

In July 2023, I started looking into making the t3 stack cross-platform with Capacitor. But one month of research later, I came up to the unintuitive conclusion that SSR applications can also perfectly serve as mobile apps if done well. Capacitor was therefore not needed anymore, and the loader/action pattern became attractive. So I started playing a bit with Remix, Next 13.4, Nuxt, and Qwik. I was already a big fan of shadcn and I wanted it to be a part of my stack, so I thought Qwik and Nuxt were out of question. But looking more closely, everything except shadcn was ready to use with top-notch DX in Qwik while server actions were in beta in Next and there was no middleware capability in Remix. So I tried to see if anyone was working on a shadcn port and realized I could qwikify$ shadcn. Thus here I am with the 𝕏 stack on Qwik and qwikcn 🙃.
