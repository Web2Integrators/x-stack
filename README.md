# Introducing the ùïè stack

- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Fullstack framework: Qwik**
  - Enjoy the best DX imaginable with server actions/loaders, typescript server/client RPC calls, Valibot validation, Middlewares, Image optimization, etc.
  - Make your app performant right from the start thanks to built-in Resumability, Lazy-loading ($), Signals-based Reactivity, and Edge Deployment

# How to _(wip)_

## Test locally

- Clone project `git clone https://github.com/x-ploration/x-stack.git`
- Install dependencies `npm install`

### Add env variables

- Copy `.env.example` into `.env`
- Add `AUTH_SECRET` with this [secret generator](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32) or with `openssl rand -base64 32`
- Add Discord provider `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` with https://discord.com/developers/applications. You will need to create a new application (top-right corner button `New Application`) and copy the "client id" and "client_secret" from oauth2 settings.
- Add Planetscale env vars. `DATABASE` `DATABASE_HOST` `DATABASE_USERNAME` `DATABASE_PASSWORD` with https://app.planetscale.com/. Go to `branches`, select your branch, click `connect`, and copy/paste.

### Add discord redirect

- Add discord redirect to your localhost url (e.g. `http://localhost:5173/api/auth/callback/discord`)

### Replace GA4 property

- In root.tsx, change id=G-VNBJX46X1T to your own GA4 property id

## Deploy

- Push your code in a new github repository
- Go to vercel dashboard, `Add New` project (top-right button) and select your repository. Remember to add production env vars (the database env vars should point to your production database).
- On your terminal, run build command `npm run build`
- On your terminal, run deploy command `npm run deploy`
- Add discord redirect to your production url (e.g. `https://x-stack.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/discord`).

# Evaluation & Alternatives _(wip)_

## Fullstack Frameworks

TLDR: For most projects, the most important criteria for choosing a framework is the ecosystem.

- 1Ô∏è‚É£: Thanks to its serialized/resumable/compiled model, Qwik scores at the highest in many aspects: SSR _(ofc)_, but also Reactivity, DX, and **the ecosystem** (because you can run React inside of Qwik üëÄ). Anything you can do in React, you can do in Qwik. But the opposite is not true. I wonder what could be possibly done in other frameworks that couldn't be in Qwik ü§î.
- 2Ô∏è‚É£: If you ask me, I'd say React / Next / Remix comes next (üëà). They are not as good in terms of Reactivity as Svelte, Solid or even Vue, but you will find libraries you won't find natively built in the other frameworks (ex: [react webcam](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-webcam)) and get newer trendy libraries sooner (hi üëã [shadcn](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui)).
- 3Ô∏è‚É£: I'd say it's Svelte, because it is lightweight and brings significant performance gains, and it has Sveltekit ready. Rich Harris has also got some swag üëå.
- 4Ô∏è‚É£: Vue / Nuxt 3. Although I highly respect Daniel Roe, I think appart from small performance gains, Vue 3's composition api is simply React hooks into Vue. It isn't worth losing the ecosystem.
- 5Ô∏è‚É£: Solid / Solidstart. Although Ryan is one of my heroes, Solidstart is still not solid (üëà) enough to be used in production ‚òπÔ∏è.
- 6Ô∏è‚É£: Angular...

# FAQ _(wip)_

### Is the ùïè stack ready for production?

Although some pieces are still in beta (auth.js, drizzle, valibot, qwik-ui's headless components), I am confident that this stack can already be used in production.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Since some shadcn components must be rewritten natively or imported with qwikify$, this is a hard piece to use with Qwik atm. I have already started porting a few components and will spend most of my time on this before I can confidently release v1.

### Who are you?

I'm an indie dev and I've had the chance to work on many projects that required learning many different technoligies. I have worked extensively with React vanilla in a project that used the GRAND stack (Graphql, React, Apollo, Neo4j Database). I've worked with Next 12 for my portfolio website using the t3 stack. I've worked with Nuxt 3 on a French government site. And I've tried my hands at Sveltekit for a side hustle. I have to admit, I've only read Solid's documentation üôà.

### Why?

In July 2023, I started looking into making the t3 stack cross-platform with Capacitor. But one month of research later, I came up to the unintuitive conclusion that SSR applications can also perfectly serve as mobile apps if done well. The loader/action pattern thus became attractive and I started playing a bit with Remix, Next 13.4, Nuxt and Qwik. I was already a big fan of shadcn and I wanted it to be a part of my stack, so I thought Qwik and Nuxt were out of question. But looking in more closely, everything except shadcn was ready to use in Qwik while server actions were in beta in Next and there was no middleware capability in Remix. So I tried to see if anyone was working on a shadcn port and realized I could qwikify$ shadcn. Thus here I am with the ùïè stack on Qwik and qwikcn üôÉ.
